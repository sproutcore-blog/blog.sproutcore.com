We're having a SproutCore meetup in Paris on **Tuesday, August 3th at 8:00 pm (EDIT: we originally planned to do it on the 5th but we had to reschedule)**. Charles, the creator of SproutCore, will be here, as well as members of the core team. Whether you're already familiar with the framework of just curious to know more about it, join us for a beer at the [Café Léa](http://maps.google.com/places/fr/paris/rue-claude-bernard/5/-chez-l%C3%A9a).

Hope to see you there!
