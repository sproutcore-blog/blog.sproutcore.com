ialexi is working on a super-cool new animation layer for SproutCore.  He's recently posted some of his [Animation Benchmarks](http://create.tpsitulsa.com/blog/2009/10/21/javascript-animation-benchmarks/) as well.  Right now he's testing with moving 3,000 label views at once.  I'm pretty sure it will handle your UI really well too.




Great work ialexi!
