Hot on the heels of the 1.4 release, we've now released 1.4.1. This is a very minor bug fix release with one fix each to Abbot (the build tools) and the Framework. In Abbot, we fixed an issue with string escaping in a call to the YUI Compressor in sc-build. In the Framework, we changed SC.Request's X-SproutCore-Version header to report 1.4 instead of 1.0.




To get the update, just run `gem install sproutcore`.
