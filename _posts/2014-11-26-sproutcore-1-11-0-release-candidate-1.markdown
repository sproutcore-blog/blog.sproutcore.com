We are pleased to announce the pre-release of SproutCore 1.11.0. Where version 1.10 drastically reduced the memory use of SproutCore, 1.11 goes even further to ferret out bottlenecks and improve the overall performance for SproutCore apps.

This new version also introduces many API improvements and additions to further ease the development of modern large scale web applications. When 1.11.0 final is released in the coming weeks, we will post an in-depth look at the major changes, but until then, the full list can be viewed here: https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

To install SproutCore 1.11.0.rc1 for testing, please upgrade your previous version of SproutCore by running the following:

gem update sproutcore --prerelease

We will be using your feedback over the next few weeks to finalize 1.11.0, so please be sure to try it out and let us know what you think: [Github Issues](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/issues), #sproutcore on IRC or email to sproutcore@googlegroups.com.
