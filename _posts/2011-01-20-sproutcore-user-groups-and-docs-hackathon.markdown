Things are taking off for folks interested in starting local user groups! 2009 saw the resurgence of the [San Francisco group](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore/), and thus far, just in January, groups have been announced in both [New York](http://www.meetup.com/Sproutcore-NYC/) and [Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore-chicago/), with dates on the way. If you're interested in starting a group in your area, we'd love to help you get off your feet! [Send us an email](mailto:meetups@sproutcore.com) and we'll get in touch :)




The next edition of the San Francisco User Group will be all about the docs—we'll be gathering, hackathon style, to work on general documentation and the new [SproutCore Guides](http://guides.sproutcore.com/). There's been a major recent interest in getting our documentation resources up to snuff to keep up with the growing number of new developers looking to dive in, and this is the perfect way to keep the momentum going.




There'll be a small, but not _too_ small group gathering on-site in San Francisco, and a number of folks joining us via the web. We'll start with some intros, talk about how to divvy up the work, and then pair off. SproutCore Core Team members Yehuda Katz and Peter Wagenet will be on-site and online leading the festivities and answering questions.




If you'd like to join us, on or off site, be sure to RSVP. To attend in person (there *will* be pizza and drinks, courtesy of the folks at [Strobe](http://www.strobecorp.com)), hit the main [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore/calendar/16083185/?success=event_edit_short&eventAction=editing). To join us remotely (and there are, alas, only a small number of spots, to be sure we can work with everyone in attendance), there's a [separate Meetup invite](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore/calendar/16125969/?from=list&offset=0) for you.
