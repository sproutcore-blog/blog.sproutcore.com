If you like to find new music from independent artists, you'll love the latest SproutCore 1.0 app from AloneTone, [ListenApp!](http://listenapp.com/)




ListenApp is the kind of player I wish all online music sites had: fast, easy to use, and beautiful.  It's simple UI helps you find music fast so you can start listening right away.




Sudara, the developer, says ListenApp! is still very early in development.  Some features are still missing here and there but if you're looking for a demo of the cools things SproutCore 1.0 can do for your site, look no further.




Great work!
