Contributor & community member Umberto Nicoletti has discovered a great way to develop SproutCore applications – and SproutCore itself – using Cloud 9's great browser-based IDE for free, any time, and anywhere, including his living room! He's got a step-by-step guide to firing `sc-server` off in a Cloud 9 workspace up on his blog; check it out [here](http://unicolet.blogspot.it/2013/07/developing-sproutcore-apps-on-c9io.html).
