With this library, we finally have a generalized way to write vector graphics across all browsers.  Now we just need to make this code easier to generate.




Next step: extend SC.RenderContext in SproutCore with methods to emit standard SVG code.  This way you can easily write vector graphics in any view without having to learn SVG.
