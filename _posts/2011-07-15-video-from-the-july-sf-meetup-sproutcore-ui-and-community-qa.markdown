Thanks to everyone who came out for the SF SproutCore Meetup this past Tuesday! For those of you who couldn't make it, Majd Taby gave a talk about what's coming in SproutCore UI; afterward, we had a town hall meeting about SproutCore 2.0 and a variety of other questions from the community. We even had Yehuda Katz give an impromptu presentation! 

We've included video from the talk and from the Q&A; below. Thanks again to our friends at Yelp for providing us with pizza, beer, and a recording with audio so clear it sparkles!

Check out Majd's talk on SproutCore UI:

You can follow along with his slides, [available here](http://t.co/Vr4sq6M).

Here's the Q&A; that followed:


One of our first community questions, about choosing which version of SproutCore to use:


There are more questions and answers from the evening's town hall online on [the SproutCore Vimeo account](http://vimeo.com/sproutcore). Take a look--they might have answered _your_ questions!
