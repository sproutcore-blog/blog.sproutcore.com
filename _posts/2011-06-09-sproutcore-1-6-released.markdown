We're pleased to announce that SproutCore 1.6 is now out!

SproutCore 1.6 is largely a bug fix release aiming to help provide a more stable experience. If you're using SproutCore 1.5 it should be a relatively straight-forward upgrade.

For more information on the changes, see the [Abbot changelog](https://github.com/sproutcore/abbot/blob/REL-1.6.0/CHANGELOG) and the [framework changelog](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/blob/REL-1.6.0/CHANGELOG.md).

Upgrade now [via package](http://www.sproutcore.com/install/?redirect=1) or, if you installed via RubyGems, runÂ `gem install sproutcore`. Enjoy!

By the way, we're still on a six week release schedule so that means we're planning to release 1.7 in mid-to-late July. Keep an eye out for more news on 1.7 in the coming weeks.
