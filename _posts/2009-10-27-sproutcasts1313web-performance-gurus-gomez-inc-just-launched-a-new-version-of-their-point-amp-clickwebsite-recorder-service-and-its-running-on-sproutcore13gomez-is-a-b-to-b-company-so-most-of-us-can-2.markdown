<blockquote>

> 
> Web performance gurus Gomez, Inc. just launched a new version of their point & click [website recorder service](http://www.gomez.com/products-solutions/technology/the-gomez-recorder/) and it’s running on SproutCore!
> 
> 

> 
> Gomez is a B-to-B company so most of us can just fiddle with the app, unfortunately.  But if you’re lucky enough to work somewhere that uses Gomez, go give it a try.  The team there did some great work.
> 
> 

> 
> (For the record: the Gomez Recorder is 0.9.  I’ve had some great input from them while preparing 1.0 so I hope they’ll be able to come along to the new platform soon.)
