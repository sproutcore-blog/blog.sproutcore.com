Thanks to the hard work of Nick Crohn a draft version of the SproutCore Reference docs are now available at http://docs.sproutcore.com!




Note that these are draft docs generated automatically from the documentation source.  They have not been fully reviewed for accuracy or completeness, so expect to find bugs here and there.  But its a great start!




**Introducing sc-doc**




These docs are generated automatically using the doctool (based on [jsdoc-toolkit](http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/)) bundled with the SproutCore build tools.  Nick has made it really easy to use this doctool for SproutCore or even for your own app.




In your SproutCore project just type:




<blockquote>sc-doc your_app_name</blockquote>




To generate docs for your app.  To generate docs for SproutCore use:




<blockquote>sc-doc sproutcore/desktop</blockquote>




All documentation is placed into tmp/docs inside your project.




**Chipping In**




Thanks again to Nick for all of his hard work on this project!   There are a lot of other cool features coming in this area, but simply having the reference docs online in a Google-friendly way is a huge step forward.




If your interested in tracking the progress with the documentation project for SproutCore - code-named Dogfish - (or even pitching in to help), you can find more information on the [Dogfish Wiki Page](http://wiki.sproutcore.com/Dogfish-Introduction).
