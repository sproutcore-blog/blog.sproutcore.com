Link: [SproutCore at Velocity Fall 09](http://en.oreilly.com/velocityfall09#agenda)

		

Just a reminder - I will be talking about some of the new loading techniques we are working on for SproutCore 1.1 at Velocity Only Fall next Tuesday, Dec 8.




The conference is online - which means you can attend from your own desk.  Why travel when you know you'd just spend the time hacking on your laptop anyway.  Hack and listen from the comfort of your own desk!




If you're interested in attending (all the other talks are great too) you can get a 25% discount using the code velfall09sdc
