Link: [SproutCore Is Now on Gemcutter](http://gemcutter.org/gems/sproutcore)

		

Gemcutter is the new replacement for RubyForge. Â It is faster and more reliable, which is great if you just want to install SproutCore and not worry so much about the Ruby.




The sproutcore gem will be published on both Gemcutter and standard RubyGems so you don't have to change anything.




If you want to try using the Gemcutter service, just follow the instructions on the Gemcutter home page to get going.
