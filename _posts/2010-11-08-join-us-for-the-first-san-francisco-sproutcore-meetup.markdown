You've all been asking for it, and it's time to deliver! It's been a nice long while since our last few meetups (embarrassingly long, even—don't look it up...), so you definitely want to join us for this one, as we get things kicked off again.




[We'll be meeting on Tuesday, November 23rd, 6:30 p.m. in downtown San Francisco](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore/calendar/15344043/) (SOMA, to be specific) for our first proper SF Meetup. Get to know SproutCore creator (and the evening's MC) Charles Jolley, along with members of the SproutCore Core Team—Evin Grano, Yehuda Katz, Peter Wagenet and more—as they walk us through some of the latest and greatest developments in SproutCore. We'd also love to hear about how _you've _been using SproutCore, so come prepared for lightning talks!




Our friends at Strobe will be sponsoring with pizza and drinks, and Engine Yard will be hosting. The space is great, but _is_ limited, so [be sure to RSVP via Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore/calendar/15344043/). See you there!
