Hey SproutCore enthusiasts!

We're moving our SproutCore meet ups online! It's been a bit since the last Vancouver meet up and, in an effort to make these sessions more accessible to people, we've decided to host our next event strictly online. Our next meet up is scheduled for Tuesday, August 14th at 4pm PST. Our scheduled panelists for this session are [Dave Porter](http://blog.sproutcore.com/welcome-to-dave-porter-sproutcore-committer/) and are [Tyler Keating](http://blog.sproutcore.com/author/tkeating/).

Dave will be presenting on "Tips and Tricks for Blazing-Fast List Views", best practices for optimizing your collection views to create the smoothest possible experience in a variety of circumstances, and Tyler will be leading a discussion on SproutCore 1.9 and 2.0.

We've also repurposed the Vancouver SproutCore Meet Up page for these events, so to keep in the loop with upcoming online meet ups [join the group page](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore-online) on Meetup.com.

There have also been new projects developed and launched using SproutCore like [Kobo's](http://www.kobo.com/) new [Instant Reader app](http://www.appnovation.com/work/instant-reader-app) and the [Wheelz](http://www.wheelz.com/) mobile [Admin Console](http://www.appnovation.com/work/admin_console). Check out all the latest projects using SproutCore [here](http://sproutcore.com/about/#tab=whos-using-sproutcore).

Hope you can make it to our session on August 14th!
