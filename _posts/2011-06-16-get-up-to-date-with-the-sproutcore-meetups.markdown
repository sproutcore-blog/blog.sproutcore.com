Have you been to a SproutCore Meetup yet? If you haven't, now is the time! 

Since February, we have grown from having 3 active meetups in the US to having 10 internationally- and several more in the works. We're excited by the energetic response we've received from you, the SproutCore community, and hope many of you are able to come and share in the awesomeness (and swag!). 

We're always looking for ways to involve more community members in the user groups. If you're interested in speaking at any of the existing meetups, or if you're interested in starting a meetup in your neck of the woods, email us at community@sproutcore.com- we'd love to have you!

In the meantime, we want to share some talks that have been given at recent meetups: The Future of SproutCore, by Tom Dale at the Chicago meetup on May 24, and Structuring Teams to Build Large-Scale SproutCore Apps, given by Peter Bergstrom to the San Francisco meetup on June 14th.

On the 14th, the SF group was also lucky enough to hear a great talk by Colin Campbell on the ABCs of Building a SproutCore App. Unfortunately, we had a bit of a hiccup recording Colin's talk, but stay tuned for a blog post next week where he'll take you through the code examples he showed. 

Until then, you can find the [code from his presentation here](https://github.com/ColinCampbell/Contact).

In this talk, The Future of SproutCore, Tom Dale explains some of the changes that are coming in SproutCore 2.0, and hopefully answers a few questions you may have about where SproutCore is headed.

Bear with us on the audio for the first portion; the echo goes away quickly :)

Watch here as Peter Bergstrom expands on his blog post about structuring teams and division of labor on large-scale SproutCore projects.

We hope you found these recordings helpful- and next time, we hope to see you in person!
