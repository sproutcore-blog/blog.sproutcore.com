I just tweeted this also but Wed Aug 5, I'll be visiting the Kiva offices in San Francisco to help them sprint on their new SproutCore-based Kiva Loan Browser.




Kiva is a great organization that makes it possible for you and me to loan small amounts of money to entrepreneurs in developing countries. Â It's a great cause and a great chance to build a cool SproutCore app.




If you're in the area, please RSVP at the link above and drop on by.
