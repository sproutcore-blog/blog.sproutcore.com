Yay!  SC.TableView is coming to SproutCore!




The full implementation is not done yet (column resizing and reordering in particular are not fully functional) but the basics are working - it should be enough for most casual users today.  You can see it in the demo code we just posted to samples:




[Go to the SproutCore Table View Demo »](http://demo.sproutcore.com/table_view/)




**(NOTE: This is alpha code.  Scrolling is still a bit choppy.)**




Note that the team that initially developed SC.TableView changed direction and decided not to use table view after all.  There are other people using it who I believe will contribute additional features, but if you find something you want missing in this code, please feel free add it and contribute it back.
