If Â you need to plot charts and graphs, some folks in the community have put together a few frameworks that are just for you.




  * **[Flot Framework](http://github.com/imxiaobo/iamxiaobo/tree/master/frameworks/flot/)** - For general graphs checkout the Flot integration by Bo Xiao


  * **[JSXGraph](http://github.com/stepheneb/jsx_graph_test/)** - For plotting and point charts by Stephen Bannasch
