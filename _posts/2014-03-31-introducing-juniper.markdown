It's been noted often that there's a serious lack of production-level SproutCore apps with readable source code. Developers often learn best by poking at something and seeing how it works, but until now there hasn't been anywhere to go.

With an eye towards improving that situation, I'm excited to announce Juniper, a SproutCore app and annotated codebase. Check it out:

[http://juniper.dcporter.net/](http://juniper.dcporter.net/)

I wrote a fuller introduction [here](http://dcporter.net/2014/03/juniper), and the source code itself is [here](https://github.com/dcporter/juniper).

If you're new to SproutCore, or wondering if it's right for your project, give it a poke! If you have any questions, say hi on [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/sproutcore) or on [IRC](http://sproutcore.com/community/#tab=irc). Any seasoned developers that want to give it a critical look-over should do so too – it's intended as a showcase of possibilities and best practices, so if you spot something, hit me up in the GitHub Issues or [directly](https://twitter.com/davecporter).

(Juniper is inspired by Vesper, a really great note-taking app for the iPhone. If you have an iPhone and are underwhelmed with the built-in Notes app, you should [check it out](http://vesperapp.co/).)
