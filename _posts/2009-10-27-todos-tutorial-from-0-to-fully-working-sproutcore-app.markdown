Ever since we released SproutCore 0.9 in 2008, people have asked for a tutorial that takes you from zero all the way  through talking to a backend server.




Well, now we have one.  The Todos tutorial shows you how to build an app, add a model, add some views, hook up the controllers, write a simple server, and finally wire your app to the server.  It's fun!




There is even a choose-your-own adventure portion where you can pick the backend technology of your choice for the server.




Please give the[ Todo's tutorial](https://sproutcore.pbworks.com/Todos%C2%A0Intro) and try and help us make it better.  The tutorial is a wiki so you can fix any problems you find right away.  Or leave comments.




We also need help adding support for more backends.  Currently the Sinatra is the only officially supported one.  Drafts exist for PHP and Merb, but they need to be updated.  If your favorite server tech is something else -- add it.




Happy Todo-ing.




PS. You need the very latest SproutCore for this to work (1.0.1009 - that's one GREATER than RC1 we released a few days ago).  Make sure you "sudo gem update sproutcore"  before you begin.
