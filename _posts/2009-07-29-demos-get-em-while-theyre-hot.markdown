If you'd like to checkout some of the latest features in SproutCore 1.0, mosey on over to the new demo site at [demo.sproutcore.com](http://demo.sproutcore.com).

This site has a simple launcher that will take you to all of the various demo apps we have installed there.  The source code for this site can also be found on github so you can see how this stuff works.




The home page for the demo site, by the way, is the updated "Welcome" app that will soon be available in the sc build tools as well.  Now when you go to http://localhost:4020/, you'll get this nice launcher instead of the ugly "No Target Found" message.  Yay
