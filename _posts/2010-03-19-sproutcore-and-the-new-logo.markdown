Just in time for SproutCore 1.0, I'm excited to officially announce that SproutCore has a new logo contributed by community member "endash".  Here's it is:

Along with the new logo, we've also updated the [SproutCore website](http://www.sproutcore.com) with a simpler, but I think far more informative version.  Thanks to Tom Dale who put in a few late nights to make this new content happen.  I'm especially excited about the new [Getting Started](http://www.sproutcore.com/get-started/) page that takes you through installing and creating a Hello World in just a few easy steps.




Many thanks to endash and Tom who helped to make SproutCore look at good as it works!
