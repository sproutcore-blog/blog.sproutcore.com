Shortly after the new SproutCore site launched, tymofi contacted me on IRC and asked "how can I help translate this into Russian?"  Since SproutCore's build tools have localization support, it turns out this is quite easy;  you just fill in a strings.js file and your done.




Yesterday tymofi sent me both [Russian](http://www.sproutcore.com/home/ru) and [Ukranian](http://www.sproutcore.com/home/uk) translations.  We also added a nifty language picker in the upper-right corner.  (Also SproutCore code)

Of course, the site right now is pretty small (just the home page, a blog and a wiki).  The translations only apply to wrapper content and the home page.  Eventually we will add more page to translate as well, but this is a nice start.




Adding new translations is easy and since the [website is open-source](http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-website/tree/master), you can clone it and make changes anytime.  Add your favorite language, send it to me, and we'll post it here.
