I'm pleased to announce that SproutCore 1.7 beta is now available. This release is largely a bug fix release and the addition of some minor features so if you're using 1.6 and like the cutting edge you should check it out. Installers are available for [Mac](http://installers.sproutcore.com/SproutCore-Beta.pkg) and [Windows](http://installers.sproutcore.com/SproutCore-Beta.exe). If you're using RubyGems, just run `gem install sproutcore --pre`. A word of warning, however: if you're using the installers the beta will overwrite any previously installed versions of SproutCore. As always, share any issues you encounter on [Github Issues](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/issues).
