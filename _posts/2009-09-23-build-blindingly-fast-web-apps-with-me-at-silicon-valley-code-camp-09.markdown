The weekend of October 3-4, I'll be presenting at SiliconValley CodeCamp on SproutCore 1.0.




The title of my talk is "[Build blindingly-fast Web Apps with HTML5 and SproutCore](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx?ForceSortBySessionTime=true&id=254)" which is really cool because with SproutCore 1.0 we can actually back that up.




Anyway, the conference is FREE and it comes with over 100 other really interesting sessions.  If you live in the Bay Area come see me on Oct 3 and get a look at the all new SproutCore 1.0.




Be sure to register your interest to ensure we get a room large enough to accommodate you.
