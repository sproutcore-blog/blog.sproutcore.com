We've just released a 1.5 pre-release gem. There's still a lot of flux and it's not considered stable so we don't recommend it for production apps, but if you'd like a sneak peek of the new features take a look. To install just run



    
    <code>gem install sproutcore --pre</code>




We'll be releasing more information about the new features in 1.5 over the coming weeks so keep an eye out.
