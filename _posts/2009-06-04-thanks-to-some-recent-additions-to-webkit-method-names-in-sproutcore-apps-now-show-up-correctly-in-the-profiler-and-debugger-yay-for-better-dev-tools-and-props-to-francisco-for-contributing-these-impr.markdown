Thanks to some recent additions to WebKit, method names in SproutCore apps now show up correctly in the profiler and debugger!  Yay for better dev tools.  And props to [Francisco](http://www.alertdebugging.com/2009/04/29/building-a-better-javascript-profiler-with-webkit/) for contributing these improvements to WebKit.




  
To see these improvements for yourself, just get the latest [WebKit Nightly](http://www.webkit.org) and [SproutCore 1.0 code](https://wiki.sproutcore.com/Abbot-Setting+Up).  Then debug/profile to your heart's content!
