**Update: **Sprint will begin at 6pm PST on Thursday, Sept. 17 and run until 10 pm.





Would you like to help create an auto-admin application for SproutCore's datastore? This is a follow up to the work on django-sproutcore started last week, but is not Django-specific: the admin application will be usable with any SproutCore schema, not just those auto-generated by django-sproutcore.




We'd love your help! If you're interested in participating in this 4hr "sprint" this week, please add your name to the list at [http://wiki.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-django+sprint ](http://wiki.sproutcore.com/sproutcore-django+sprint). We'll pick the night (PST) that works best for everyone and work for around 4 hours straight. Everyone is invited.




The sprint will be moderated by Erich Ocean for the duration. The date and time chosen will be posted to this blog. I hope you can make it!
