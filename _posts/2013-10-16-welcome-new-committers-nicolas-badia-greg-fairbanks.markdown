We're pleased to announce that **Greg Fairbanks** and **Nicolas Badia** have accepted becoming SproutCore Committers. These two have been especially active in submitting fixes and improvements to the framework and are great examples of persevering through the process of vetting pull requests with the core team in order to ensure each change meets the high standards of SproutCore. It can be a tedious process to get something approved, but the end result is better code that stands the test of time. Now that they are official Committers this will become even easier for them.

For those that aren't sure of the difference between Committers and Reviewers, Committers are actually required to work in their own branches in the repo and submit every change as a pull request to be accepted by a Reviewer. The Reviewers are allowed to make direct fixes, but will most likely submit anything at all substantial as a pull request too in order to get a few other Reviewers' feedback and acceptance. Both roles also include the responsibility to try to move the outstanding issues and pull requests towards a resolution.

As you can tell from the above description, both roles are a lot of work and it takes people with a real dedication to the project to accept what can be a thankless and demanding task, so please take a moment to catch all of these people on #sproutcore and sproutcore@googlegroups.com and show them your support.
