SproutCore 1.4.4 is now out! This is mostly a bug fix release, though there are a few things worth noting.




First off, anyone on the bleeding edge of Chrome may have noticed some odd behavior on Chrome 9. This is a bug in Chrome 9, but we've added in a workaround so you don't have to wait on them to fix it.




We've also added support for enabling Chrome Frame in your app, just set `:chrome_frame => true` in your Buildfile config and then we'll automatically add the appropriate meta flag to your index.html.




SC.copy also now has support for deep copy. This means that all children of the item that you're copying will also be copied. To use this, do `SC.copy(obj, YES)`.




Also, we've added a property called SC.buildMode that will return a value of 'debug' when you're running from sc-server.




And finally we've added support for custom MIME types in sc-server. Set `:mime_types => { '.suffix' => 'mime/type' }` in your Buildfile config to get sc-server to use the appropriate MIME type. Remember, this will only help you in development, you'll need to configure your deployment server separately.




As always just run `gem install sproutcore` to get the latest goodness, and feel free to comment here or reach out elsewhere if you've got questions.
