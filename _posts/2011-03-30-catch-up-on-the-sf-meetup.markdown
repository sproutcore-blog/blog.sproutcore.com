A big thanks to everyone who braved the rain and came out to last week's San Francisco SproutCore Meetup! We had a great time chatting with all of you before and after; and hope you had your fill of pizza and learned a thing or two :)




If you missed the Meetup, fear not! Through some highly experimental webcamming, we've put together two talk recordings. It's not quite as awesome as your very own neighborhood Meetup, but it's a start.




Forgive the audio quality on Tom's talk-- it took us a little while to work out the kinks with our mic. We promise to be better next time :P




Check out Tom's talk on the View Layer:

There's also Yehuda's introduction to SproutCore/Updates for the 1.5 beta:Â

Lastly, save the date: our next meetup is happening on Tuesday, 4/26! Keep an eye on [the Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/sproutcore/) for specific details.




See you there!
