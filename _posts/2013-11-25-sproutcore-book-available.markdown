Although it has been out for a couple weeks already, I had never officially announced the completion of the SproutCore Web Application Development book in this blog. So for anyone that has been waiting for a book on SproutCore, you should know that it has finally been completed and you can [purchase a copy here](http://goo.gl/5UZxiP).

This book covers almost every aspect of SproutCore with detailed explorations of the runtime environment, the MVC layers that SproutCore brings, using statecharts, interacting with multiple remote data stores and many many other topics all the way through to unit testing and deploying real SproutCore applications. So if you're looking to take the next big leap in web software development and have ever been curious about SproutCore, now is your chance to learn everything you need to know in one easy read.

Thank you!
