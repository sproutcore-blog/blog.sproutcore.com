[Martin Ottenwaelter](http://github.com/martoche) is a developer based on Paris (lucky) who has contributed immensely to the development of SproutCore 1.0 over the last year.  He has helped to fix dozens of bugs and most recently contributed the excellent [SC.DateTime](http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore/blob/master/frameworks/foundation/system/datetime.js) class for handling multiple timezones.




I'm very pleased to welcome Martin to the core team which means he'll be making commits directly to the main source.  You can also now file tickets in Lighthouse related to the parts of SproutCore he is responsible for and he can pick them up.




Welcome Martin and thanks for all your great work!
