Suvajit Gupta and some friends have been working on a very exciting project for the last few months.




[Tasks](http://tasks.sproutcore.com/tasks) is an agile project planner for software written in SproutCore and [Persevere](http://sitepen.com/labs/persevere.php) (a JavaScript server).  You can add projects, plan tasks, assign them to users, track their completion state, testing state and more.   It's a great end-to-end example of a complex SproutCore 1.0 app.




Best of all, Tasks is open-source.  The team that wrote this app has been building large scale SproutCore 1.0 apps commercially for almost a year now.  They have a lot of experience that you can tap just by looking at their code.  You can also contribute if you're looking for a place to get your feet wet.




Task is still very early in its development. There are a lot of rough edges and missing features.  Eventually, however, we'd like to get to a point where we can use it to manage SproutCore's progress instead of Lighthouse.




I love the speedy interface and immediate feedback that is there already.  I'm really looking forward to the other great ideas this team has planned.




For now we're hosting an updated version of the app at [tasks.sproutcore.com/tasks](http://tasks.sproutcore.com/tasks).  You can also [checkout the code on Github](http://github.com/suvajitgupta/Tasks/tree/master).




Great work guys!
