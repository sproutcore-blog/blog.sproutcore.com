In this 10-minute screencast, Tom Dale takes you from creating an empty SproutCore project to building a simple todos application. You'll learn about defining model objects, crafting a user interface using HTML, then connecting them together with controllers. While doing so, Tom explains how thinking of your app in terms of its state, instead of how to respond to events, will change the way you build applications.
