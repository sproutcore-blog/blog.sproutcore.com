You know how they say that the real world produces the best software. @frozencanuck, a member of the team here at @eloqua, has written an open source Ruby testing framework called Lebowski which leverages Selenium and is specifically designed for Sproutcore and it's unique needs.  Here is a [post](http://frozencanuck.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/introducing-lebowski-a-test-automation-framework-for-sproutcore/) where he talks about it in detail and you can find the repository for it [here](http://github.com/FrozenCanuck/Lebowski).  It is still in development, but we are starting to use it in our big SproutCore application.
