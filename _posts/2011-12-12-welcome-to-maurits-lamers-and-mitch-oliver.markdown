Hot on the heels of last week's introduction of five new team members, I'm pleased to announce that **Maurits Lamers** and **Mitch Oliver** have also signed on as SproutCore Committers.  As with the people from my previous post, these names should be of no surprise to anyone who has been with SproutCore for some time.

For those that aren't sure of the difference between Committers and Reviewers, Committers are actually required to work in their own branches in the repo and submit every change as a pull request to be accepted by a Reviewer.  The Reviewers are allowed to make direct fixes, but will most likely submit anything at all substantial as a pull request too in order to get another Reviewer's feedback and acceptance.  Both roles also include the responsibility to try to move the outstanding issues and pull requests towards a resolution.

As you can tell from the above description, both roles are a lot of work and it takes people with a real dedication to the project to accept what can be a thankless and demanding task, so please take a moment to catch all of these people on #sproutcore and sproutcore@googlegroups.com and show them your support.
