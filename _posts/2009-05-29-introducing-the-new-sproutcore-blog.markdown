If you follow the links in one of our blog posts today you may find the blog looks a bit different. And by different I mean generic.  What's going on?




In preparation for SproutCore 1.0, we're planning to launch a new website.  Part of our site redesign involves switching to the Tumblr blogging platform from Wordpress.




We want the SproutCore Blog to be the go-to source for discovering what's happening in the world of SproutCore.  Tumblr makes that easy by offers tools to easily link to other resources around the web in a "tumblog" format.




Even though the site redesign is not yet complete, as we gear up for the new SproutCore 1.0 launch, we wanted to go ahead and get started using the new Tumblr features to document some of our progress.  In the mean time, the main site will remain up while the blog itself will soon redirect to this new site.  If you are reading the blog through a feed, you should automatically switch to receiving new posts from this blog instead.




Happy tumbling.
