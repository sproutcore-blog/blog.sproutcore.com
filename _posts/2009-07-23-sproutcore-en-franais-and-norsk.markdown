Hot on the heels of Russian and Ukrainian, today we got translations for French and Norwegian as well!  German is coming soon.




OK, so our website is simple right now and these localizations are small, but this is a great chance to work out the localization feature in SproutCore.




If you're interested in how this works, check out the [web site source](http://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-website).
