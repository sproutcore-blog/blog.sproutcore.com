SproutCore is about to get a new release on February 29, 2012 and we want to kick it off with an important sprint over the last weekend of the month.  As an open-source project, the success of SproutCore depends on you and others like you, so please consider setting aside some time to get involved.  Thanks!



	
  * **Name**:  SproutCore 1.8 Release Sprint

	
  * **Dates**:  Friday, Feb. 24 through Monday, Feb. 27, free-form style

	
  * **Topics**:  Will include both code and doc tasks. Please follow the wiki page:  [https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/wiki/1.8-Release-Sprint](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore/wiki/1.8-Release-Sprint)




Aside:  We've decided that the next release of SproutCore will be titled 1.8.  It's simply an indication that the code base has changed enough since the 1.7 beta, which should have been finalized some time ago but was missed during the rocky period when SproutCore 2.0 was determined no longer to present the future of SproutCore.
