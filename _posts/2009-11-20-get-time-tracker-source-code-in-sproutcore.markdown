Bruz Marzolf is writing a series of blog posts implementing a simple time tracking app in various client-side rich web app frameworks.  He just finished [his example in SproutCore](http://blog.bruzilla.com/post/250239229/sproutcore-client-side-web-application-frameworks) and including some [source code](http://github.com/bruz/clocky-frontend-sproutcore).




Here's what he had to say:




<blockquote>SproutCore provides a higher level abstraction that manages when objects are changed and need to be updated, and when they’re busy and shouldn’t be modified, for instance.</blockquote>




Bruz' code is a good example of a basic starter app that's a little more complex than our todos demo.  I'm looking forward to his additional entries in this series also.
