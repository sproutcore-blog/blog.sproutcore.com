As you may have noticed above, there is a new section to the sproutcore.com website, [Showcase](http://showcase.sproutcore.com).  This page is meant to act as your one-stop reference for all of SproutCore's Views and Controls.

Previously, you would have had to install SproutCore and run it locally to view the Test Controls app and would have had to search the source code of that app to figure out how the Controls were configured.  Now you can visit [http://showcase.sproutcore.com](http://showcase.sproutcore.com) at any time and copy code snippets directly from within the page.  Even better, we've expanded the examples significantly to include all of the available Views and Controls with many more configuration examples.

On a technical note, the Showcase page is actually a SproutCore app itself deployed on Github pages.  The app is open-source and you can browse its source and contribute to it on [Github](https://github.com/sproutcore/showcase).

In the coming weeks, we will work to consolidate the various SproutCore demos and deploy them on this page as well, ensuring easy access to up-to-date demos.
