This is pretty cool.  Juan Pinzon has been working hard on our IE support for SproutCore. Basically he does the dirty work in IE so you don't have to.





Today he posted a short video where he loads and runs the SproutCore Sample Controls app in 6 major browsers - including an unsupported one - in under a minute.




Sample Controls involves building a UI client-side with over 200 controls all at once.  It's a real stress test.  The fact that the app loads fast enough he can navigate in one minute is really amazing.




Great work Juan!
