Of course I have no idea if this is true, but I do think that the tablet/netbook category is destined to be huge.  Most consumers who buy cheap PCs for the home do so for web browsing and email (most of which is also done through the web browser).




Web tablets have the potential to be both cheaper and more portable than a low end PC, so why would you get something else?




I predict one day web tablets will be like TVs - most households will have several.  TVs themselves will essentially become large web tablets.




Web apps, of course, will drive this demand.  And those web apps needs to be very rich.  This is why I started Sproutit in the first place.
