There's been a lot of movement on the SproutCore Meetups front as of late; if you _haven't_ been to a Meetup yet, you definitely want to try and make it out. It's a great opportunity to meet other talented developers, learn about the ins and outs, and even better, show off your code. We've got a number of Meetups happening soon, so find the one nearest you!
