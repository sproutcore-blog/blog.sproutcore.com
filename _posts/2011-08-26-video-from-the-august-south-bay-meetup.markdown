Thanks to all of you who came out to our first meetup in the South Bay, at at Nokia HQ in Sunnyvale! For those of you who couldn’t make it, don’t worry; as always, we made sure to record everything for you. 

It was quite the night— we heard presentations from Majd Taby and Greg Moeck, followed by community Q&A.; Majd started us off with a talk on how bindings help SproutCore make your application smaller, concluding with an impressive demo of his work on SproutCore Touch and TransformJS. Greg spoke about connecting SproutCore apps to your backend, and best-practice approaches based on your app's structure. 
 
Check out the videos below! Many thanks again to our friends at Nokia, who recorded the talks— note the improved video quality :P — and kept everyone happily fed with pizza, cookies, and refreshments for the night.

Hope to see everyone at the September meetup, back in San Francisco at Twitter!
