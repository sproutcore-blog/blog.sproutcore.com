SproutCore has now been updated to 1.4.2! This is a minor patch release with a handful of bug fixes to both the framework and to abbot.




In Abbot, we fixed a regression that caused sc_require to fail with uppercase filenames. We also fixed an issue that caused sc_static to load files that only partially matched the requested filename.




Additionally, we made a couple fixes to SC.DateTime and fixed Tab key behavior for SC.SelectFieldView.




To get these updates, just run `gem install sproutcore`.
