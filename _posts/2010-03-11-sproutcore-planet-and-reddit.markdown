In community news, two great new resources have just started up you might want to checkout if you like to follow the latest news on SproutCore.




[SproutCore Planet](http://sproutcoreplanet.com) is a blog aggregator that republishes blog posts from SproutCore-focused blogs around the net.




The[ SproutCore Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/sproutcore/) is another great place to see fresh new links based on community interest.




Thanks to the folks that setup both of these new sites. Â I'll be following both and contributing links to the Reddit site myself.
