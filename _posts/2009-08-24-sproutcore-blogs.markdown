Josh Holt, etgryphon and the frozencanuck are on fire lately.  They all posted some amazing articles on their blogs this weekend diving into [CollectionView Delegation](http://blog.thesempiternalholts.com/post/167999702/collectionview-delegation-pt-1), more on the [basic View API](http://www.itsgotwhatplantscrave.com/2009/08/23/basic-view-api-part-2/), and details on [KVO and Bindings](http://frozencanuck.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/making-sense-of-sproutcores-key-value-observing-kvo-and-bindings/).




It's great to see some members of our community who have been building some really amazing software over the last year giving back like this.




As the community of SproutCore bloggers grows, I've added a [new page to the SproutCore wiki](http://wiki.sproutcore.com/External-Blogs) that can link to these sites so you can easily find them.




If you write something interesting on SproutCore - especially if you start a blog dedicated to covering SproutCore topics like these fine folks - please link to yourself here.  It will drive traffic to your site and help many new devs find their way in our community.




Thanks again for all your hard work!
