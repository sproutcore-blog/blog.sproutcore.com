With Firefox 3.5 all the major browsers (including IE!) support native drag and drop.  The SC.Drag interface in SproutCore was designed from the beginning to follow the same protocols.  That means once someone SC.Drag to use native drag events, all your SproutCore-drag code will automatically work between browser windows and applications without you making any changes to your code.




HTML5 Ready.
