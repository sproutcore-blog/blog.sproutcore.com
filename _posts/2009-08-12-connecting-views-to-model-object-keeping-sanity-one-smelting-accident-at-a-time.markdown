The network of SproutCore focused blogs is growing.  For a while we've had [It's Got What Plants Crave](http://www.itsgotwhatplantscrave.com/), which has some great tutorials.  And of course Geoffrey and his excellent Screencasts (now hosted on the SproutCore site).




Now another SproutCore developer has started blogging about some of the key points he is learning along the way while he works on a new app.  This post covers bindings in some detail.  Give it a look!
