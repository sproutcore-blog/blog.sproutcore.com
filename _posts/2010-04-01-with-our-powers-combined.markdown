I've been telling everyone who would listen over the past view weeks that [jsconf](http://jsconf.us/2010) is going to be really big for us this year.  We just hit 1.0 and now we're working on our next big thing.  




Yesterday the Cappuccino team announced their [big move to manual memory management](http://cappuccino.org/discuss/2010/04/01/solving-the-javascript-memory-management-problem/).  Some of the Cappuccino core team members [even suggested](http://twitter.com/nciagra/status/11402640760) we might want to borrow some of the ideas for SproutCore.




Well, we hear you.  In fact, we're going to do you one better.  I know I should keep this a secret until jsconf, but:




**Starting with SproutCore 1.1, we will be switching to Objective-J.**




You read me right.  I'm tired of waiting for ECMAScript 5 and HTML5 to finally become real standards.  It's time to get some of this crazy stuff now!  




Converting the entire SproutCore API from pure JavaScript to a Objective-J is a big task.  But we have enough done to show you the flavor of some of it.  For example, here is how you might setup a custom view in the future:


<!-- more -->

Or even better, here is a before and after shot of the toolbar at the top of the SproutCore [Todos sample app](http://github.com/sproutit/samples-todos) converted to Objective-J:




Sexy!




Some of you might say you can't possibly merge two worlds like this.  That trying to adapt SproutCore's API to something that it wasn't designed for would make for a horrible experience.




Well I say just look at the results.  It's almost poetry.




And don't worry about backwards compatible.  All Sprout-J (working title) code is toll-free bridged so your old stuff will just work.




Of course, there is still a lot of work to do.  But jsconf is still three weeks away and we have a huge army of contractors feverishly working away on this right now to get everything converted in time.




See you at jsconf!
